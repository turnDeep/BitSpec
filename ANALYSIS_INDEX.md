## Key Findings Summary

### What Is BitSpec?
A **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for predicting EI-MS fragmentation patterns** from molecular structures. Uses NIST database for training.

### Architecture
```
MOL/SMILES → Features (48D atoms + 6D bonds) 
→ GCN (5 layers) → Attention Pooling → MLP → 1000D Spectrum
```

### Key Strengths
- ✓ Efficient molecular features (optimized to 48D+6D)
- ✓ EI-MS aware loss (Modified Cosine with neutral loss)
- ✓ RTX 50 optimized (mixed precision, torch.compile)
- ✓ Clean, modular code
- ✓ Production-ready

### Key Limitations
- ✗ **NO pretraining infrastructure**
- ✗ No transfer learning
- ✗ No PCQM4Mv2 integration
- ✗ Models train from scratch only
- ✗ Referenced approaches (Massformer) not implemented

### What's Not Here But Could Be Added
1. PCQM4Mv2 pretraining (4.3M molecules with DFT properties)
2. Transfer learning pipeline (freeze/unfreeze)
3. Massformer architecture
4. Multi-task learning
5. Generative pretraining (masked node/edge prediction)

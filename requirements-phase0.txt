# Requirements for Phase 0: BDE Pre-computation
#
# This file contains dependencies needed ONLY for Phase 0 (BDE pre-computation).
# After Phase 0 is complete, these can be uninstalled for Phase 1-3 training.
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements-phase0.txt
#
# Note: RTX 5070 Ti (sm_120, Blackwell) has limited TensorFlow support
#       CPU execution is recommended and performant enough for ALFABET

# TensorFlow (ALFABET dependency)
# Latest stable version with best Python 3.10+ support
tensorflow>=2.15.0,<2.20.0

# ALFABET - BDE prediction tool
# Paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16201-z
# MAE: 0.58 kcal/mol on 290,664 BDEs from 42,577 molecules
# Note: ALFABET requires scikit-learn==0.24.2, but we override with a newer version
#       for Python 3.11 compatibility. The API is stable enough that this should work.
scikit-learn>=1.3.0,<1.6.0
alfabet>=0.4.1

# OGB - For PCQM4Mv2 dataset loading
ogb>=1.3.6

# HDF5 for cache storage
h5py>=3.8.0

# RDKit (usually already installed via main requirements.txt)
# rdkit>=2023.9.1

# Progress bar
tqdm>=4.66.0

# NumPy (compatible with TensorFlow)
numpy>=1.23.0,<2.0.0
